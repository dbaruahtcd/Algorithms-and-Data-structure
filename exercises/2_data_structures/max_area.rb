# Container with water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, 
which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# improved version
# We have two pointers one pointing to the start and the other pointing to the 
# end. We only move the smaller of the two pointers and keep tabs on the max area
# seen so far.
# The reason for moving the smaller of the two pointers is that if we move the larger
# line, we wouldn't be increasing the area, since we would be decreasing (j-i) and the height 
# would be dictated by the smaller of the two lines. So we only move the smaller and fix the larger
# one. If after moving we encountered a larger one and j-i is smaller, there wouldn't be much improvement in the area.
# Similarly if encounter a smaller one, and j-i is less, we wouldn't get much improvement in the area.
